Mobile hybrid application.

- You in the development branch. Here we implements some new feature functionality, this version not stable, and something can be broken - so don't be some mad. :)
Tour Guide & all Tourists in the Group use the same Application. Tour Guide communicates with the members of the group using the AudioGuide System, speaks to the group. Tourists, members of the group, listen to the transmission dedicated only to the group. Password restricted, safe, 21st century solution for the Travel Industry.

Have you ever used a Headset to speak to the Group or listen to the Tour Guide? Now you can use your own device and earphones to do the same. It is a hygenic and eco-friendly, radio interference free solution. Unlimited Tour Groups and Tourists in the Group give you the opportunity to expand your list of destinations. 

Tour Guide can send Notifications to your entire Group, Tourists can send a Private Message to the Tour Guide.

Business tools give you the ability to distribute credits to your team, generate full reports of all your activities, expand your business due to the Unlimited Tour Groups and Tourists/Members of the Group.

Hearing Impaired Friendly - Our App will translate Tour Guideâ€™s voice into text, which is then sent to All Group Members.
